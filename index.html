Since it's typically impractical to reach out to every candidate and interview them, employers and recruiters usually choose to filter whom they select. This is largely done on the basis of each candidate's CV. An effective and well-written CV is therefore key to your chances of securing an interview. And whereas cover letters are typically going to differ from one job application to another, your CV is typically going to be the same and only updated once you acquire new skills, qualifications and experiences.

                A good CV is also the best complement to your cover letter. Given how fundamental it is to the job application process, taking some time to ensure that you have a good CV is almost always worth it. Furthermore, a good CV usually makes a good impression right from the start, which can be vital, as in some cases a recruiter's decision to proceed can take less than a minute.

                Tips for writing an effective CV
                A good CV is an appealing representation of your abilities, experiences and qualifications. It's supposed to secure a recruiter or potential employer's attention and then convince them that you're a good enough candidate to warrant an interview. To help you achieve this, there are some tips and best practices listed below:
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong >Choose a good format</strong>
                <br />
                How you format your CV is largely going to depend on the industry you're applying in. Typically, you might choose between a chronological, functional or combination CV. The preferences and proper format for your industry may differ, so it's a good idea to do some research to find out. You can choose to include a personal statement or to omit it, based on what you feel would be most effective. You might opt to include certain additional information, like hobbies and interests. Again, this depends on your industry, the job and what's expected.
                
                Generally, it's best to keep your CV to a couple of pages at most. In some industries and sectors, CVs may become considerably longer, although this is typically also reflective of a large amount of experience and qualifications. But a concise CV of up to two pages is usually a good balance.

                <br />
                <strong> Select an appropriate design</strong> 
                <br />

                The design behind your CV is also going to be largely dependent on your industry. A graphic designer may produce a custom design specifically for their CV, complete with a colour scheme, design elements and a professionally crafted signature. In this case, the CV is also visual proof of the skills that it describes. Alternatively, a CV for a banker or accountant is probably going to be plainer.
                
                With regard to the text, it's typically best to select a familiar and easy-to-read font like Times New Roman, Calibri or Arial, and set it to 11 or 12. Some colours can be appropriate and even preferable. This can be used to highlight certain text and increase readability.

                <br />
                <strong> Include your contact information</strong> 
                <br />

                Your contact information is almost always an important thing to include on your CV. Even if you've already included these details in an email or another part of the application process, adding them to your CV can ensure that they're readily accessible to whoever is reading it. This is also useful if you're submitting your CV to a company that hasn't posted a job.
                
                Use keywords
                Many companies use automated application tracking and filtering systems to select the most promising CVs. These applications often look for certain keywords, which is why it's good to find out what these are and include them to increase your chances of getting past the filter. These keywords are relevant to the job and company, and you can find them in the job advertisement or through some additional research.

                Proofread it
                Your CV is often going to dictate the first impression that recruiters and potential employers get of you. Some avoidable errors, like spelling and grammar mistakes, can unnecessarily hamper this by making it look like you weren't thorough. Given that a CV is usually only a couple of pages long at most, it can be proofread relatively quickly, and this can help you avoid making the wrong impression. If you're unsure, you can use an online spell checking tool or similar software to assist you, but it's usually a good idea to read it yourself in any case.
                
                Keep it updated
                As you progress through your career, your CV is going to reflect your new accomplishments and experiences. Every time you reach a particular milestone or achieve something significant, take some time to add it to your CV to keep it updated. Even if you're already working, there's always the possibility that you might be surprised by a new opportunity. This is why it's a good idea to keep your CV updated, as it's going to allow you to take advantage of these opportunities at short notice.
